# UntitledMovingCircleGame
Or UMCG for short. This is my first C++ project. Made with SFML, my blood, sweat and tears.

## How to play
There is a ball. To make it move hold down your mouse and release the ball will move in the direction, opposite of the cursor's position. Press R to reset the velocity and position.

## ToDo
- [x] Add an objective - probably collecting something
- [x] Clean up code; use OOP
- [ ] Make different screens (start game, end game, etc.)
- [ ] Preferences
- [ ] Audio
- [ ] Polish
- [ ] Cross-platform support

## Running the game

### Coding
Things you need if you want to run this in visual studio
* SFML installed
* Source code pro Regular in the directory - with the filename `SourceCodePro.ttf`

### Playing
If you don't have visual studio installed, you need to download a runtime. You can find the 2015 runtime here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
